## [2.4]
### Added

### Changed
- "N/A" mode now hides the data in the tooltip, in addition to showing no output.
- The Discord server link has been changed.

### Fixed
- Fetching loot info should be more reliable even with fast loot mode or other fast loot addons. A special thanks to Gregory and Yuyuli for bringing this to my attention and providing a solution.
