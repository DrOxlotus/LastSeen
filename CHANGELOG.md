## [3.0.5]
### NEW FEATURES
- Typing long words like 'ignore' can be tiring work. You can now supplement it for 'i' when using the ignore command. /ls i 12345

### FIXES AND UPDATES
- Apparently after the release of 9.0.1, we really wanted to let you know when you looted Silk Cloth, but we can see how that might be annoying. Items that were being ignored on Monday are being ignored again.
