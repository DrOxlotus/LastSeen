## Patch 1.0.4.1
### Things that Didn't Work as Intended (Bug Fixes)
- Items looted from PvP strongboxes should now track.
- Sinestra loot should now track using the chest.
- Encounter loot should no longer be both added and updated simultaneously.

### Things that Aren't the Same as Before (Changes)
- Quest loot no longer uses the quest's source location, but instead the player's current location. It's very confusing completing a quest in Dalaran, but the location says Badlands.

### Things that Didn't Exist, but Do Now (New Stuff)
