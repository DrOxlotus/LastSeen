## Patch 1.0.4.0
### Things that Didn't Work as Intended (Bug Fixes)
- Fixed a bug that caused items looted from chests not to track, and that caused encounter loot to go untracked.
- Items looted from satchels and other containers should track correctly.
- Looting currencies should no longer cause errors.
- More objects should now track correctly. A specific list can be found on LastSeen's GitHub wiki.

### Things that Aren't the Same as Before (Changes)
- The release version is now included in the unknown source debug message.
- Obliterum and Obliterum Ash are now ignored.

### Things that Didn't Exist, but Do Now (New Stuff)
- A new option is available! "Faster Loot", which behaves like AutoLootPlus or FasterLoot.
