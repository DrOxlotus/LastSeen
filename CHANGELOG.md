## [2.3]
### Added
- Sources are now displayed on an item's tooltip if it's been seen from 2 or more sources. Only 4 sources are shown on the tooltip, but a total count is displayed.

### Changed
- The item count in the settings frame should now update without reloading.

### Fixed
- The "Anglers' Water Strider" item should no longer add/update when entering an island.
- The appearance check should now be more accurate. [Author's Note: The appearance check should be against the item that drops, opposed to the normal variant.]
- Search should now locate all items.
- Squashed a bug that caused the itemName attribute not to return.
