## Patch 1.0.4.0
### Bugs
- Fixed a bug that caused items looted from chests not to track, and that caused encounter loot to go untracked.
- Items looted from satchels and other containers should track correctly.
- Items looted through professions like Skinning or Fishing should now track correctly.

### Changes
- The release version is now included in the unknown source debug message.
- Obliterum and Obliterum Ash are now ignored.
- Items acquired by other players will now track. Only applies to encounter loot.

### New
- A new option is available! "Faster Loot", which behaves like AutoLootPlus or FasterLoot.
