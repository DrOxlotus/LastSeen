## Patch 1.0.4.3
### Things that Didn't Work as Intended (Bug Fixes)
- Random trash drops should no longer state that they dropped from the most recent boss slewed by the player.

### Things that Aren't the Same as Before (Changes)
- Removed the "Source" prints from the add and update chat reports.
- Removed support for the BAG_UPDATE event. This should only affect players that sort their inventory using a macro.
