## [2.1] - ??
### Added
- Added German support.
- Added Russian support.

### Changed
- [Mark of Honor] is ignored once again.
- The Postmaster source has been removed. [Author's Note: The idea for The Postmaster was to allow items that dropped in a dungeon or raid from bosses to be added/updated for someone whose bags were full. I didn't anticipate players that skip looting bosses, and then acquire the items from The Postmaster later.]
- Items acquired should now strictly use the current zone name.

### Fixed
- Output should no longer show in Quiet mode.
